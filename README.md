# lidarParadigms
Implementing a lidar RANSAC algorithm in multiple paradigms.

## Task
We are given three point clouds as input files and are asked to implement a ransac algorithm for determining dominant planes (3x) for each input cloud, and usbtracting from the initial input cloud, the points belonging to a given pointcloud.

An example of an input cloud visualised in 3D:

An example of the same input cloud after points belonging to dominant plane have been removed, also visualized in 3D:
